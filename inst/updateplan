Not so much a plan for an update, but a set of notes and order-of-operations guidelines
To get a whole season's worth of data, we should:

OPTION 1
1. Get the teams
2. Use the teams to get all the schedules
3. De-dupe the schedule data

OPTION 2
1. USE https://api.nhle.com/stats/rest/en/season? to get all the season related info, which includes start/end dates
2. Use the Schedule API at the *date* level to get all the dates (should be doable by *week* if we want to keep it simple)
3. De-dupe the schedule data (if we run by week, this may not be necessary, but we'll see.)


4. Use GAMEIDs from there to get
  * BoxScore
  * Play-by-Play

5. Use Rosters to get Player level data, too


-----
Really the thing to do is build a single file for everything you want and do it piecemeal.
*START* with pulling the data, don't even think about parsing it yet.
*THEN* one by one add parsing into data.table format.

1. Schedule -- this is dumb, so do this LAST (get game-level stuff first)
2. Box Score
3. Player Stats
4. Goalie Stats
5. Shifts
6. Play-by-Play

PBP can be broken into things like shots, etc.
Don't worry about the database building element yet.  Just get data.
